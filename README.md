# Fuzzy Comp

Comparison with margins.

## Description

Notation follows Fortran's functions:

 * eq - Equal within margins
 * ne - Not equal despite margins
 * gt - Surely greater, even with margins
 * lt - Surely lesser, even with margins
 * ge - At least equal, within margins
 * le - At most equal, within margins

 Those functions can be used anywhere where we want to be just precise enough.
